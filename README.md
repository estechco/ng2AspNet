# ng2AspNet

AngularJs 2 with ASP.NET

The second part of a process of migration from ng1 to ng2, for an example project that uses ASP.NET as an intergral part of its structure.
Primarily for Authentication and Master Pages, although the migration process may identify better ways two achieve both?

Credit for the starting point of this project goes to Angular.io and their VS 2015 quick start cookbook

https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/visual-studio-2015.html

This is the SystemJs variant and will probably require you to save any one of the .ts files to generate the associated .js files?

To install simply...

git clone https://github.com/estechco/ng2AspNet.git
cd ng2AspNet
npm install

...then load VS sln file and build .NET assembly
